# BuzzWord-Game
Built a buzzword game in JavaFX, from scratch. The entire framework, modules and design were constructed, with a fully functioning game in under 90 days. The game has multiple levels and types of words. To comprehend it and make it simpler for all ages, a hint button is also added with an option to save and load at any state for multiple users.
